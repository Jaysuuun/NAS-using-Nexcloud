# üóÉÔ∏è NAS-using-Nexcloud
**üìå Overview**

  A personal NAS (Network Attached Storage) setup using Nextcloud, hosted on lubuntu virtual machine running on virtual box, for private file sync, sharing, and media storage.

**Guest access**

  **username:**\
  **password:**
  
  _Please note that there maybe intances where the server is down_

## üõ†Ô∏è Hardware & System Specs
  - **Device:** Personal Computer _(Virtual Box for the server)_
  - **CPU:** Intel i5 10500  _(3 cores allocated for the vm)_
  - **RAM:** 8GB _(4GB allocated for vm)_
  - **Storage:** Virtual Memory _50GB_
  - **OS:** Lubuntu

## üß∞ Software Stack
  - **Nextcloud Version:** Nextcloud Version 31.0.5
  - **Web Server:** Apache2 Version 2.4.63
  - **Database:** mariaDB Version 12.0.1
  - **SSL:** Cloudflare Origin Certificate

Since my ISP does not allow router access, I was unable to set up traditional port forwarding. Instead, I tunneled the connection using Cloudflare Tunnel. The domain used for this project is managed via Cloudflare DNS, and SSL is handled using a Cloudflare Origin Certificate.


## üì¶ SETUP
If you want to replicate the setup here is a setup guide for hosting your own NAS using nextcloud.\
_Please note that you will need to purchase yourown domain if you plan to deploy it remotely_\
You have the option to use a VM, personal computer/laptop, Virtual Private Server (VPS), or a dedicated server machine as your host. This setup guide uses lubuntu which is a linux distro, if you plan on host this locally using a windows you might need to look at different guides online as this setup is intended for linux users.\

### 1. Configure system hostname and host

  edit it using a text editor:
    `nano /etc/hostname`

  inside you will see _localhost_ change it to your domain _(e.g. cloud.jaysun.site)_

  edit the host file:
    `nano /etc/hosts`

  inside the file you will see 127.0.0.1 local host. Under it type 127.0.1.1 your domain name hostname _(e.g. 127.0.1.1 cloud.jaysun.site jay)_

### 2. Download Nextcloud

  using wget:
  `wget https://download.nextcloud.com/server/releases/nextcloud-31.0.5.zip`
  manually dowload at:
  [https://download.nextcloud.com/server/releases/nextcloud-31.0.5.zip](https://download.nextcloud.com/server/releases/nextcloud-31.0.5.zip)
  
### 3. Dowload and Setup MariaDB Database

  download and install:
    `sudo apt install mariadb-server`

  check status:
    `systemctl status mariadb`

  This is a security script included with MySQL and MariaDB that helps you quickly harden your database installation by walking you through basic security steps.
    `sudo mysql_secure_installation`
    
  üîê What it does:

  - Set or change the root password (if not already set).\
  - Remove anonymous users (to prevent anyone from logging in without a user account).\
  - Disallow remote root login (optional but recommended for security).\
  - Remove the test database (which is often installed by default and accessible to all users).\
  - Reload privilege tables (to ensure changes take effect immediately).\
    
  It‚Äôs a good first step after installing MySQL or MariaDB, especially on a production or public-facing server.

  After entring the command say yes (type y) for unix_socket authnetication then create a root password for you mariadb server and finaly say Yes to all the following prompts or just press enter.\

### 4. Create a databse for nextcloud

  Enter mariadb:
    `sudo mariadb`
    
  Create a databse:
    `CREATE DATABASE nextcloud;`

  Grant All previlage on current user for the databse:
    `GRANT ALL PREVILEGES ON nextcloud.* TO 'currentuser'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'mypassword';`
    `FLUSH PREVILEGES;`

  To exit press ctrl D.\
  
  Feel free to use whatever name you want for your db if don't want to name it nextcloud.\

### 5. Install Apache2 and PHP

  Install apache and php:
    `sudo apt install php php-apcu php=-bcmath php-cli php-common php-curl php-gd php-gmp php-imagick php-intl php-mbstring php-mysql php-zip php-xml apache2`
    
  you can ommit apache2 since php installs it for you anyway but leave it if you have trust issues. 

  Check if its running:
    `systemctl status apache2`

  Open you browser and type your domain or localhost you should be seeing an Apchache2 default page. 

### 6. Install Nexcloud Files

### 7. Setuo Apache and PHP

If you are using a VPS, dedicated server or a personal machine and **is able** to **port forward** you might want to follow and contibue the setup at [28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpr37FJSgrw&t=1872s&ab_channel=LearnLinuxTV&t=1692s) otherwise if you are unable or is not allowed by your ISP to port forward you can use tunneling services like [zrok](https://zrok.io/), [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) and etc. For this project I used [cloudflared tunnel](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/get-started/create-remote-tunnel/) for the free SSL certificate.
